# code_sample

Here is a coding sample from an econometrics project I did in Spring 2020. Since then I wrote an honors thesis and did coding work for ECONorthwest. I am unable to publish my honors thesis because it uses confidential data. My work for ECONorthwest was mainly data cleaning and creating graphs.
